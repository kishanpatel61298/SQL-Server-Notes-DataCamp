--ORDER BY

SELECT TOP (10) product_id, year_intro
FROM products
ORDER BY year_intro DESC, product_id;

--DESC keyword will sort the column(yesr_intro) in descending order. If there is no explicite keyword is mentioned,
then it will sort column(product_id) in ascending order.
--In above query, there are multiple columns to sort with. So, execution will start by first sorting "year_intro" in 
descending order. After that "product_id" will be sorted in ascending order accordingly.
